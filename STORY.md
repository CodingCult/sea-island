- ... to be decided

celia's born as a tadpole and lives in a small pond in richmond. she slowly grows in her pond by
swimming through obstacles and collecting food, gaining and losing abilities as she turns into a
frog. just before she loses her tail completely, she sees a cat who introduces himself as wynn.
his fur is black but he glows blue (unclear whether this is in reality or just a visual)

--- start cutscene ---

"who are you?"
"oh hi frog, i'm wynn! the local black cat :::3333"
"im celia! nice to meet u ::o where are you heading?"
"i'm going to sea island!"
"sea island?"

--- end cutscene ---

she follows him down fraser river after jumping out of her pond for the first time. she finds
out that she likes flowers and gets to choose to wear any flower on her head after seeing them
for the first time and meets another cat who is wynn's girlfriend, mimi!! shes gray

somewhere along the way... bottle with map

wynn tells celia to collect the first flies she sees, then after a while, they come across a
fisherwoman, susan, fishing at steveston who buys their flies for them to end up with about 20
gold. celia continues following wynn until there's a rockslide over the tunnel wynn takes and
they're trapped on opposite sides of it. celia needs to find her way around the tunnel.

eventually they reunite just before the bridge to sea island and walk it together (just a really
simple walking in the rain, holding an umbrella together !!!) on sea island they get to a
skytrain station and find andré wandering. he gives celia a compass, then asks if they want to
buy something.

andré's a weird character. he wears a turtle hat and kinda whispers to them (diff font). he's
also crazy and has magic stuff
