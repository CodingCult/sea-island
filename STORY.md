celia's born as a tadpole and lives in a small pond in richmond. she slowly grows in her pond by
swimming through obstacles and collecting food, gaining and losing abilities as she turns into a
frog. just before she loses her tail completely, she sees a cat who introduces himself as wynn.
his fur is black but he glows blue (unclear whether this is in reality or just a visual)

"who are you?"
"oh hi frog, i'm wynn! the local black cat :::3333"
"im celia! nice to meet u ::o where are you heading?"
"i'm going to sea island!"
"sea island?"

--- end cutscene ---

she follows him down fraser river after jumping out of her pond for the first time. she finds
out that she likes flowers and gets to choose to wear any flower on her head after seeing them
for the first time and meets another cat who is wynn's girlfriend (lawrence's cat)

they come across a fisherwoman, susan, who buys their flies. then they buy items from andre!
